# Docker/Django Overview
This is a Django docker container. To download docker for Windows: [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

## Start docker container
At the command prompt enter:
```
docker compose up
```
When you see the line *Quit the server with CONTROL-C.*, use **Docker Desktop** to launch the browser. Or you can go to the CLI (command line interface).

## Stopping docker container
When you are done working with the docker container, you can stop it with the command:
```
docker compose down
```
The docker container state will be saved when you run the command *docker compose down*

**Another way**<br>
Check out [Django Girls: Virtual Environment](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#virtualenv), to view instructions for creating Python virtual environments on either Windows or MacOS. This virtual environment will let you develop multiple Python websites at the same time. Use in conjunction with Github and it will be easy to publish content on the web using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
